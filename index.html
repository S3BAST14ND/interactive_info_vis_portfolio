            This sketch visualizes the current time as a graph, with minutes on the x-axis and hours on the y-axis, enabling quick at-a-glance recognition through spatial understanding similar to how an analog clock is read. It is intended for focused contexts such as studying or analytical work, where users benefit from perceiving time relationships visually rather than reading precise numeric values.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for use in an environment where tasks take place throughout the day, such as a kitchen, office, classroom, etc. Because of the length of tasks undertaken in this space, it is useful to have an at-a-glance representation the current time.</li>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Graph-based encoding:</strong>
          Minutes and hours are mapped to Cartesian axes to represent time as a spatial relationship instead of a circular cycle. This preserves the intuitive spatial reasoning users apply to analog clocks while being easier to read from a distance or at a glance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Line and area representation:</strong>
          A line connects the current hour and minute, while the area beneath it represents the accumulation of time within the hour. This reinforces the idea of time being gradually consumed rather than instantaneously updated such as a digital clock may seem. This design does not directly rely on interpreting colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex to Display:</strong>
          The target device of this representation is a screen or display of some kind, as one drawback is the density of pixels needed and the ability to display small details, as well as large changes not as suitable to a display with limited outputs
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Future iterations could focus on user interaction such as allowing users to scrub through time, set timers or alarms and represent them on the graph, or changes to the time scales to represent days or months if selected. Another focus area could be finding a way for the time representation to look complete at the end of the day, as a graph will always look "half-full"</li>

        <p class="small-note"><b>Reflection</b> Overall, this was the simplest clock of all. I began by really liking this idea, and was pretty determined to make it my final product. However, after receiving feedback and reviewing, people found this concept to be underwhelming, the connection between time and the graph to be confusing, and overall that it did not achieve the goal of at a glance readability. I believe this feedback is true, and while unique this visualization does not bring much to the table. This was my first attempt, and I chose to leave it as a draft, and focus on other visualizations.</p>

          <p class="small-note">This Visualization explores a natural representation of time, which can be seen passing with the changing of tide levels at a beach. This visualization focuses completely on spatial cues, and contains no numbers. The logs represent hours, the bird 5 minutes, and the sun and moon am/pm indicator positions left and right as 7PM-7AM, and 7AM-7PM respectively.</p>
          <p>
            
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> Context: This sketch is intended for low-attention contexts where time awareness should be subtle, such as background display, studying, or reflective environments, rather than for tasks
              requiring precise timekeeping with numerical values. This clock would fit well in an environment that is used for many hours a day, and a general notion of time is appreciated.</li>
              <strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Minimal visual elements:</strong>
                  This visualization prioritizes minimal visual components in order to reduce cognitive load, and allow for quick interpretation. This is enforced by rounded geometry and soft colors
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Color pallette and element size:</strong>
                  Distinct colors are chosen to ensure that color perception is not directly needed in order to perceive this visualization. Elements are large enough to be distinguishable without the need for color.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of numeric values:</strong>
                  The lack of numeric values in this visualization is intended to remove stress that can come from sticking exactly to a schedule of some sort, and simply provide an idea of the time that is at worst plus or minus about 25 minutes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, more details could be experimented with such as more exact minut e displays, as well as days or weeks. Another option could be experimenting with the design of the ocean and changing the amount of animation.</li>

        <h3>Favorite Visualization - Iterations and Feedback</h3>
          <p class="small-note">I chose this as my favorite visualization. This was because I believe it fit the best into the general theme I was going for, which was visualizations which express time in spacial ways, without relying on numbers or accuracy. This visualization tell time accurately down to 5 minutes, and up to 24 hours without a single numeric field.</p>
          <figure>
            <img

            />
            <figcaption><strong>Iteration 0:</strong> this was my final visualization before I began iterations. It contained waves, logs to tell time every hour, and a sun/moon to represent am/pm</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img
              class="sketch-image"

              alt="Tidal Clock visualization — iteration 2"
            />
            <figcaption><strong>Iteration 1 — revised visualization after peer feedback:</strong>I asked a group of Informatics students from another class I am in to provide some feedback on this design, and they said it was strange to see a clock with no movement or indication of time passing. As a goal of this visualization is to be soothing, I added some gentle wave movements, as well as some texture to the ocean to bring the beach to life a bit. This is not visible in the screenshot, but can be seen in the visualization above.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img
              class="sketch-image"
              src="images/fav_iteration_2.jpg"
              alt="Tidal Clock visualization — iteration 3"
            />
            <figcaption><strong>Iteration 3 — refined visualization with final annotations:</strong> I asked my roommate for feedback on this version, and he said that while the visualization makes sense, 15 minutes is a long time between indications. To remedy this, I added a small bird that sits on top of the logs. It moves one log to the left every 5 minutes, and then resets at the beginning of the hour. This allows for more accurate timekeeping, without the need for numbers.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="small-note"><Strong>Final Iteration - current:</Strong>Finally, I asked my parents who I had dinner with for their thoughts and they did not have much to say aside from the fact that this clock could be even more immersive if the sun and moon moved across the sky. I added logic to the sun/moon AM/PM indicator so that it would change at 12:00AM/PM, and move across the sky after 7AM-7PM, representing the pacific northwest.</p>
          <p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="small-note"><b>Reflection</b> This was by far my favorite visualization. After creating all the clocks, the themes of simple, spatial representations of time with minimal numbers and low accuracy took shape. I believe this visualization represented this the most. It has absolutely no numbers, and yet is accurate to +- 5 minutes. This being said, I believe that it does have the weakness of not being intuitive, and there is no quick way to figure out how to read it. In the future this could likely be expanded upon, but for now I believe it does the job well. Getting feedback on it was enjoyable, as it is also the most visually impressive of the three.</p>

          This Timer is designed for short time spans where the exact minute and second don't matter. Following the philosophy I have been using for this assignment, this visualization gives a general spatial awareness of time remaining, without the stress of the exact minute and second. Setting the timer in the minute field can be done from 6sec-60mins, and start and stop functionality is up to you to figure out!
          <p>
            
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This timer is designed for short, focused timing tasks such as studying,
              meditation, cooking, or taking breaks, where users benefit from a calm, physical metaphor for
              the passage of time rather than a precise numeric countdown. The visualization emphasizes
              temporal spacial awareness over exact measurement, but still allows for precise time inputs.
            </p></li>
              <strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Candle as main element:</strong>
                  I chose a candle as the main visual element of this design as I believe it makes intuitive sense. Its shape allows for estimation of time passing as as it burns, and when the time is over it burns out to symbolize this fact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Interactivity:</strong>
                  I chose to make this visualization interactive, but in a way the mimics real life, and has as little focus on actual numbers as possible. The timer is started and stopped by interacting with objects on the screen, instead of buttons, which I believe adds to the theme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accessability:</strong>
                  I believe this design is very accessible and usable by anyone able to manipulate objects with a mouse. It is visually understandable and makes sense to use. I also added labels to explain the functionality. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, accessability could be improved by creating a way to use this visualization without a mouse such as a screen reader and buttons hidden from visual users. Audio cues would also be useful to indicate when the timer is done.</li>

      <div>
        <p class="small-note"><b>Reflection</b> This was by far the most complicated and difficult visualization to complete. It has many interactive features, which made the coding process extremely time consuming. It was difficult to break down the functionality into single commits, so some of the commits are close together in time, as I wrote a large chunk of code, then committed it in pieces. However I believe this visualization fits well into the theme, as it has minimal numbers, and uses spacial awareness to show time passing, instead of exact numbers. It was a conscious choice to hide the exact time during use, and I believe this is a close runner up to the final visualization.</p>
